# CodingChallenge

Had fun with this. Published it as gem.

## Installation

1. via cloning

Clone repo. Then in project directory `bundle install`.

2. via rubygems

``gem install coding_challenge```

## Usage

To run with a cool CLI UI at the start, either do:

- (IF CLONED) Go to project directory and: `./exe/coding_challenge start [product type] [options]`
- (IF INSTALLED AS GEM) from CLI do: `coding_challenge start [product type] [options]`

To run without a cool CLI UI at the start, either do:
_ (IF CLONED) Go to project directory and: `./exe/coding_challenge start [product type] [options] --skip_intro_animation=true`
_ (IF INSTALLED AS GEM) from CLI do: `coding_challenge start [product type] [options] --skip_intro_animation=true`

## Testing

Clone and go to project directory and do `rspec spec`
